# FindYourFood
Matching some one's taste with a restaurant.

### Behind the scenes
We are going to get the reviews from many websites, as much as we can.
Then we will try to build a matrix with the reviews. 
If "you" want a rating of a place, we will use "your" previous ratings
as input to the matrix to find the places that are more likely to be
appealing to "you".
